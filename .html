 4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example
 Tag:
 An HTML tag is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that defines the purpose and 
structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the 
content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the 
element enclosed within the tags

Example of a Tag:
<p>This is a paragraph tag.</p> 
In this example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag. The content "This is a paragraph tag." is the 
text within the paragraph element.
 Element:
 An HTML element is a complete unit that includes an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It represents a 
distinct part of a webpage's content or structure. Elements are composed of tags and the content enclosed 
between those tags.
Example of an Element:
<P>This is a paragraph tag.</P>

In this example, <p> is the opening tag, "This is a paragraph element." is the content, and </p> is the closing tag. 
Together, they form the complete <p> element, representing a paragraph of text


  5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?
    Answer:
    The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML is a special instruction placed at the beginning of an HTML document to 
   specify the version of HTML being used. It ensures proper rendering and parsing by web browsers. The most 
   common declaration, <!DOCTYPE html>, indicates the use of HTML5, the latest version of HTML
